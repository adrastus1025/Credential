1. Introduce your self
	I've been a software engineer for nine years and I've worked as developer at companies like Healthcare Logic and Netgru.
	During my career, I've built numerous web and mobile applications using different techonlogies.
	I'm proficient in React and Angular for fronend and node and asp.net for backend.
	My expertise also lies in databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
	In addition to my technical skills, I'm a team player and comfortable collaborating with cross-functional teams.
	I've successfully deployed my last project to from development to the final product stage.
	However, my contract recently ended, and I'm now looking for a new opportunity.

2. Why did you leave your last role?
	

2. What was your responsibility?

	I took the charge of entire cycle for specfic features from requirent gathering to design and develop
	I developed Rest Apis with Asp.net and build responsive user interface with Angular.
	I did the uni-testing and end-to-end test and also have experience mentoring junior developers
	But my main responsibility was developing.

3. Talk about last project

	The project is mainly used for data visualization from huge data
	It helps clinicians and hospital managers to make a smart decision and optimize the performance for management. It also monitor hospital demand, patient activity and patient flow and more.

	Additionally it has functionality for a patient to find the nearest and suitable hospital so we used google maps.
	The project requires robust back-end system that could handle authentication and dynamic front-end interface for displaying many hospital highcharts and informations.

	For fronend I used Angular to create a dynamic and  responsive user interface. So I used Angular Material to create reusable UI components and I also used highchart.js and d3.js for visualization.

	For backend I used .net to develop RESTful apis that communicated with SQL Server database. I also integrated various third-party apis and libraries and implemented a system that used AWS lambda and SNS(Simple notification Service) for real-time mornitoring.
	The project gives me valuable experience.

4. What is your biggest challenge?

Front

	One of the biggest challeng that I faced was cross-browser compatibility and how to test and debug the app's functionalities and compatibility across different browsers, devices and platforms.
	It was demanding. So we implemented a responsive design with TailWind CSS and for testing we used BrowserStack.
	It is a cloud-based service for testing and debugging.

	We need to build robust web application.
		For secure communication, we used TLS

		To prevent some attacks like XSS, so we implement CSP header to control the sources which the browser can load resources
		It was difficult because we need to know different types of XSS attacks - stored, reflected and dom-based
		Also the project inclueded user-generated content and third-party integrations so it was really complex.
		We Always sanitize user input to ensure that it does not contain executable code.
		And also we used Anti-CSRF Tokens to prevent CSRF attack.

Asp
	Another challenge was how to make a efficient real time communication.
	So we used SignalR for communication.
	But there are some difficulties like the connect was lost when the browser is inact for a long period of time.
	I fix it with configuration and add additional logic for watching connections.

Python
	Designing an efficient database schema and optimize the database query is one of the challeges in Django developing especially when the project grows.
	Understanding Django's ORM(Object-Rleational Mapping) is very important. It allows us to interact with database without SQL query directly.


	Version conflicts for integrating third-party apis
	When you discover a version conflict, you can make your code more flexible by implementing version compatibility layers or adaptors. These layers can translate between your code's expectations and the API's behavior.


5. What are you looking for a next role?
	I want to use my skill and experience to build and maintain high-quality, scalable, and reliable web applications.
	I want to be part of company's growth
	Work with a talented and experienced engineers
	Continue to learn and grow as a developer especially in devOps and clouding services, who is reputable and innovative


6. Team composition and how to follow agile methodology?
	In our company, which comprises a team of 20 members, 12 are dedicated software engineers, divided into 5 for frontend, 5 for backend, and 2 serving as QA engineers.
	Additionally, our team includes 2 skilled designers specializing in UI/UX, alongside a project manager and a product manager, as well as the scrum master.

	We have integrated the Scrum methodology to optimize our development processes, enhnace collaboration among our team members.
	I provided technical expertise and insight into the implementation for proposed tasks and prioritize tasks based on their importance in sprint planning meetings
	We conduct daily stand-up meetings, during which we share progress updates, discuss our immediate tasks, and address any obstacles or blockers.

	Our development cycle operates on a bi-weekly sprint basis, allowing us to release product increments every two weeks.

	Following the conclusion of each sprint,we had the sprint review and the sprint retrospective.

	In terms of team collaboration and communication, we utilize the Slack platform to facilitate seamless and efficient interactions among our team members.


7. How to you keep up with the latest technologies?
	I always use online resouces. I follw technology news websites, blogs and social media channel related to software development. Sites like Hacker News, Reddit.
	I attended conferences or meetups to learn about latest trends of technolgies(Google I/O, Microsoft Build)
	And I also I use some popular software engineering publications like TechCrunch, Wired and so on.
	Podcasts are the great and convinient way I think. I can even listen the podcasts while doing other tasks.


8. How to handle large amount of data?
	Load only the data that is needed at the moment.
	So I can implment pagination and infinite scroll 
	For heavy computations, use Web Workers to perform tasks in background threads, avoiding UI freezes.
	Use virtualization libraries (like react-virtualized or react-window in React) to render only the items in view, significantly reducing the number of DOM nodes.
	Cache data on the client side to avoid unnecessary network requests

How https works?
	HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. In a nutshell, it works like this:
	1. Request-Response: A client (typically a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server. This request includes a method (e.g., GET, POST), a URL, and optional headers and data.
	2. 	Server Processing: The web server receives the request, processes it, and generates an HTTP response. This response includes a status code (e.g., 200 for success), headers (e.g., content type), and the requested data (e.g., a web page).
	3. Data Transfer: The response is sent back to the client over the internet.
	4. Client Rendering: The client (e.g., web browser) receives the response, interprets it, and displays the web page or resource to the user.

	OAuth (Open Authorization) is an open-standard protocol that allows secure authorization and authentication between two applications, typically a user and a web service or between two different web services. It is commonly used to provide a secure and standardized way for users to grant applications or services limited access to their resources without sharing their login credentials.
