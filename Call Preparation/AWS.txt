I used AWS for hosting static websites.
And I also used AWS Lambda for building serverless functions that provide backend functionalities. For example I can create Lambda functions to handle API requests, data


CI/CD version	-control	Git, GitBucket
Build Tools		npm
platforms		Jenkins, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD, Travis CI, Bamboo, and GitHub Actions, among others, offer environments 				 where CI/CD pipelines can be defined and executed.
Containerization & Orchestration: Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration have become key in many CI/CD pipelines to ensure consistent and scalable deployments.


What is container?
	Container: A lightweight, stand-alone, executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.

What is ochestration?
	It is the automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex computer systems, services, and middleware. It involves using automated tools to deploy, manage, and scale applications and services.

Experiences with AWS

	1. Compute:
	EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): Virtual servers in the cloud. Essential for hosting applications, backends, APIs, etc.
	Lambda: Serverless compute service, allowing you to run code in response to events without managing servers.

	2. Storage:
	S3 (Simple Storage Service): Object storage for hosting assets like images, documents, and even static websites.
	RDS (Relational Database Service): Managed relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server.
	DynamoDB: Managed NoSQL database service.

	3. Networking:
	VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): Isolated cloud resources, where you can define your IP address range, subnets, route tables, and 					network gateways.
	Route 53: Scalable domain name system (DNS) and domain registration.
	
	4. Developer Tools:
	CodeStar: Suite of tools for CI/CD pipeline (including CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline).
	Cloud9: Cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) for writing, running, and debugging code.
	
	5. Containers & Microservices:
	ECS (Elastic Container Service): Fully managed container management service.
	EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service): Managed Kubernetes service.
	Fargate: Serverless compute engine for containers.

	6. Application Integration & Middleware:
	API Gateway: Create, publish, and secure APIs at any scale.
	AppSync: Build data-driven apps with real-time and offline capabilities using GraphQL.
	Elastic Beanstalk: Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for deploying web applications.

	7. Security & Identity:
	IAM (Identity and Access Management): Manage user and programmatic access to AWS services.
	Cognito: Provides authentication and user management for web and mobile apps.

	8. Analytics & Monitoring:
	CloudWatch: Monitor resources and applications, collect and track metrics.
	X-Ray: Trace and analyze user requests as they travel through applications.

	9. Front-end Web & Mobile:
	Amplify: Development platform for building secure and scalable cloud-powered serverless web	and mobile applications.
	Device Farm: Test web and mobile apps on real devices in the AWS Cloud.
