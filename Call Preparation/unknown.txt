team composition and methodology

We used scrum for development there was only 50 members five members for frontend, six members for backend, 3 members in QA, and also project manager

We had two-weeks sprint, at the beginning of the sprint we had a sprint planning meetings to organise user stories and divide the tickets and sprint demo meetings
and we also have daily stand ups to checkout the progress. In the meeting what what we did yesterday, and what will I do today and blockers

we used git for version control
make pull request on git and after reviewing, we merged to the main branch.
